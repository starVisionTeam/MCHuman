This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of "Squeezing Multiple Cues from a Single Image for Clothed 3D Human Reconstruction". 

<img src="./Assets/overview.png" alt="overview" width="100%">

  **NOTE**: The current model is trained in a low-resolution dataset called THuman1.0, which contains simple poses and clothes. Fortunately, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on human images with complex poses and loose clothes.

  **The code is released, but not complete. We are still updating it.**

  **NOTE 2022/11/25**:  Our paper has been submitted to *IEEE Transaction on Multimedia*. Good luck. This page shows more results generated by our method on in-the-wild images collected from the Internet. 

  **NOTE 2022/12/17**:  The core code and pre-trained models have been uploaded. They can be downloaded from [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/16b_Pmu0HVW_QxnP9P0ms1g?pwd=tj6r). Install instructions and commands for training the network (directly or incrementally) will be updated and uploaded soon.

  Coming Soon！

You can download our provided pre-trained models from  [Download link](链接：https://pan.baidu.com/s/16b_Pmu0HVW_QxnP9P0ms1g?pwd=tj6r) and put them into the `./checkpoints` directory. 



  ## Run Demo
  In ```test_example```, we provide two examples, which contain an image with a SMPL model fitted to the image and another image from the Internet. 
  ```bash
  python demo.py - input_dir                        
  ```
  ## Train the network directly using all cues
  Please run the following command to train the network:
  Coming Soon！
  ```bash
  bash 
  ```

  ## Train the network incrementally by plugging and unplugging cues 

  Please run the following command to train the network:
  Coming Soon！

  ```bash
  bash 
  ```
