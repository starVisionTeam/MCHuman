  **NOTE**: The current model is trained in a low-resolution dataset called THuman1.0, which contains simple poses and clothes. Fortunately, our method also achieves state-of-the-art performance on human images with complex poses and loose clothes.

  **The code is released, but  not complete. We are still updating it.**

  **NOTE 2022/11/25**:  Our paper has been submitted to *IEEE Transaction on Multimedia*. Good luck. This page shows more results generated by our method from Internet images.

  ## Run Demo
  In ```test_example```, we provide two examples, which contain an image with a SMPL model fitted to the image and another image from the Internet. 
  ```bash
  python demo.py - input_dir                        
  ```
  ## Train the network directly using all cues
  Please run the following command to train the network:
  Coming Soon！
  ```bash
  bash 
  ```

  ## Train the network incrementally by plugging and unplugging cues 

  Please run the following command to train the network:
